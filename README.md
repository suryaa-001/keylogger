# Software Keylogger only for educational purpose

A Python keylogger captures and logs keystrokes from a user’s keyboard. It operates in the background, recording each keystroke into a log file. The keylogger can use libraries like `pynput` to monitor keyboard events. It’s often used for monitoring user activity, though ethical and legal considerations are paramount.
